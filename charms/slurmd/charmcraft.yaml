  Slurmd, the compute node daemon of Slurm.
description: |
  This charm provides slurmd and the bindings to other utilities
  that make lifecycle operations a breeze.

  slurmd is the compute node daemon of SLURM. It monitors all tasks running
  on the compute node, accepts work (tasks), launches tasks, and kills
  running tasks upon request.
